# Flexbox Layout Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to flexbox layout in CSS. The bug occurs when the total width of flex items exceeds the width of their container.  Some browsers handle this situation incorrectly, leading to unexpected layout results.

## The Problem

The `bug.css` file contains CSS code that uses flexbox to arrange items. When the combined width of the items is greater than the container's width, certain browsers might collapse the items or render them in an unexpected way.  This inconsistency across browsers can make debugging difficult.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file provides a solution to address this layout issue. The solution utilizes additional CSS properties to ensure consistent and predictable layout behavior across different browsers, regardless of whether the item widths exceed the container width.
