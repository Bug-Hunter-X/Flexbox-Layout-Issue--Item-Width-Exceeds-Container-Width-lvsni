The following CSS code snippet causes an unexpected layout issue in certain browsers:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: blue;
}
```

The issue arises when the total width of the `.item` elements exceeds the width of their parent `.container`.  In this case, some browsers might unexpectedly collapse the items or render them incorrectly.
